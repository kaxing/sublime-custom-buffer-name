#### Sublime Plugin - Custom Buffer Name
\- Tested and developed with Sublime 4 (build 4152)  
\- Uses Python 3.8 (defined in .python-version)

#### The idea
This plugin basically allows the user to change the new file(buffer) default naming from "untitled" to a custom prefix and follow with numbering. E.g., "Note 1", "Note 2", "Note 3".  
I think this plugin will be handy for people who never really want to save files and use sublime like a Pastebin.
