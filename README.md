### Sublime Plugin - Custom Buffer Name
- Tested and develop with Sublime 4 (build 4152)
- Uses Python 3.8 (define in .python-version)

#### The idea
I think this plugin is going to be really handy for people never really want to save files and use sublime like a pastebin.

What it does is basically allow user to change the new file(buffer) from "untiled" to anything else following with numbering. Eg. "Note 1", "Note 2", "Note 3".
